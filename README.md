This project aims to implement a machine learning model to detect fire using cameras. The model utilizes a Visual Geometry Group (VGG16) algorithm and libraries such as Matplotlib, Numpy, Keras, and OpenCV. It achieves a high accuracy rate of 97%.The model can be used indoors for quick fire and smoke detection using laptop Web camera using openCV library.
